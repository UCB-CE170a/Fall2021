Hello, my name is Renjie Wu. This is the day1 of our python tutorial. In this video, I will walk you through our python exercise using Google Colab. 


Colab, similar to google slides. 
File hosted on github, need to copy to google drive. 
.ipynb -> Ipython Notebook. Composed of cells. Text cell and code cell. 

Python is a programming language. It runs on a computer, so it must be capable of computing things. 

First thing we are going try is to use it as a pocket calculator.
Middle school, gravitational potential.  

Math operation has orders. Multiplication before addition. To prioritize one operation, use parentheses around it. 

My calculator can remember previous answers. We achieve by using variables and assignment.
