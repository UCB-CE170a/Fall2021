Explain the physics problem. 
Explain module. External library to help you do operations the native python environment can not do. Python is light and efficient with only required modules or libraries. 

I can do it on my hand/calculator. Lets see the power of programming in the next example. 
Simple way: Try different angles. Computer never get tired on doing boring repetitive works. 
We need a container to hold all the angles we want to try. 

Having a list is not intuitive. Engineers prefer graph because it shows more information such as trend. 

Plot multiple lines on a graph.
