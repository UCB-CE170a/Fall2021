# Python Exercise Day 0

## Objectives
* Fundamentals of programming 
* Introduce python
* Introduce github/colab
* Tips & Resources

## Programming 
**So, what is Programming?**
> Programming is a way to "instruct the computer to perform various tasks"

To let people do stuff, you talk/yell to them. To let computers do tasks, you program/bug them. 

**Ok... Why should I bother about coding?**

* **Efficiency.** Let the computer do repetitive tasks so you can have extra time doing more meaningful things, such as watching cats on Youtube. 
* **Self-sufficient.** Don't pay extra money on commercial software! With coding skills, you can program by yourself (less likely) or use open source programs. (Yeah!!)
* **Sharpening your mind & be responsible.** Computer does whatever you told them. If your program does not run, it is always your problem. Think clear, write clean, and blame no one. 
* **You have to do it.**  As a student, it is part of your grade. When you start working, it is part of your salary. 

## Python 
Python is extremely popular:

So what is python?
> Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. 

Above is the definition of python from the [official python website](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb/). If you don't understand it, I will explain it. 

* **Interpreted**: Unlike many programming languages such as C++, python does not need to be compiled before execution. You can understand compilation as a translation process that translates the language you understand (programming language) to the language your computer understands (machine language). Python has its own embedded interpretor, so as long as your syntax (grammar) is correct, it will be automatically complied (interpreted) and ready to be run. 
* **Object-oriented**: You can group similar things (name, age, id)together to form an object (person). A very powerful technique. Read more on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming). 
* **High-level**: It uses natural language elements, so the developed program is simpler and more understandable than using a low-level language. In other words, you write less but achieve more. 
* **Dynamic semantics**: you can assign to one object multiple values, as it will update itself during runtime. 

In summary, python is very popular and easy to write. Being popular means many open-source codes to borrow (import), and being simple is always a good thing. 

## Github
To make a long story short, Github is a website that hosts open-source codes. You use Google/one drive to host your files and Github to host your codes. It also ties with "git", a version control program that preserves your codes histories.

## Colab 
Using Google Doc, you can write and share your documents in your browser. Using Google Colab, you write/execute and share Python codes in your browser. As there is no need to install Microsoft Office on your computer to use Google Doc, you don't need to configure the programming environment to run Colab. Python tutorials and homeworks will be presented in Colab for this class.

## Tips
* [Google](https://www.google.com/) is your best friend. If you are confused, ask Google. 
* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is your second best friend. If you see strange error messages popping up from your program, search on there. 
* If you can not find answers online, keep calm and post your question on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). 
* Be patient. Rome is not built in a day. 
* Do python exercises in this repository and watch my videos. 
* Taking serious computer science classes. Considering taking [UCB CS61A](https://cs61a.org/) for general programming, [UCB CS61B](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/sp20/) for data structure, [UCB CS61C](https://cs61c.org/su20/) for computer architecture.
