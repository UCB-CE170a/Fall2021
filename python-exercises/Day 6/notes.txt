We have used numpy library in previous tutorials to perform some math operations. 
Today, we are going to give a short introduction of the numpy library. Numpy is very large lib, we just introduced a tiny parts here. For more information you can either search on internet or go to numpys official website. 

Motivation on using numpy: engineers need to deal with math, 
numpy is dedicated on math operations, especially for multi-dimensional (vector) math operations. Two benefits: 1. lots of functions we can use. 2. all these functions are fully tested and optimized. They are fast. 

How to use numpy to represent data. 

Now we learned how to represent data in numpy. Lets see the power of numpy. We can do array arithmatic and call functions form numpy. 

Lets show the performance benefits of numpy.
