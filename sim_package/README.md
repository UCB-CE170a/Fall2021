# Berkeley PATH Traffic Simulation Package

This package is intended to create an extensible package for creating custom traffic simulations and emergency analysis metrics.

This package is still in development. As such, PyPi might not have the most up-to-date benefits. Simply pull this repo and run `pip install .`


### Dev Note
for arm64 machines (apple silicon), to install scipy this worked `pip install --pre -i https://pypi.anaconda.org/scipy-wheels-nightly/simple scipy`
