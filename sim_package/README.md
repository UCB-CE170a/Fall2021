# Berkeley PATH Traffic Simulation Package

This package is intended to create an extensible package for creating custom traffic simulations and emergency analysis metrics.


### Dev Note
for arm64 machines (apple silicon), to install scipy this worked `pip install --pre -i https://pypi.anaconda.org/scipy-wheels-nightly/simple scipy`
